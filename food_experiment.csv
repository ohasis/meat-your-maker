Red Trays
Plastic Cups
Triton To-Go Boxes",61,60,60,1,"People would buy food and take red trays, bowls, paper bowls out. Can’t identify how they disposed food they bought

Many people used red trays (reusable)

Triton to go disposal machine was broken. Don’t know if that affect how many T-Go boxes that were used

HDH workers collected trays, bowls, and plastic cups from outside and disposed of them correctly

Some people have multiple trays, complexity doesn’t seem to affect accuracy of food disposal

Some people disposed things in groups. Harder to identify if the did it correctly 

One area to dispose means increased focus in how to dispose? Vs Sixth (more chaotic and disposal in both sides) or ovt (small, things pile up fast)

Workers were replacing the bags during this times d they were put into different bins. Don’t know where they end up going. Not fully confirmed, but they seem to all be waste and go into the same bin

The disposal area also had hdh workers in the back (similar to Pines/Cafe V). Workers can see from their peripheral vision how well they are disposing

During the replacement process, the worker assisted several students in helping them dispose of the food

Could be useful to fill out a separate spreadsheet counting for each prompt on the survey. Would be able to tabulate data more accurately 

HDH Workers also had breaks during this time. They were accounting into whether subjects disposed of their meal

Surprisingly added up to a solid amount. Shows that even if Warren is not “known” for having lots of people on non-peak hours, it was either to tabulate and still get a good number in and analyze their patterns, irrespective of whether it’s truly considered a “rush” or not",8:00:00 PM

",38,3,32,6,"Most subjects did not study the signs posted at the trash cans-most threw their trash away based on the color of the bin (blue, green, black).  Most people were in a rush to eat and leave, however most disposed of their food properly.

Most people glance at the bins and dispose of them as convenient, half of the time they do it right. 
didn't observe anyone who took the time to analyze the disposal of their materials. 
A significant amount of people only pile up or do whatever just to leave. 
HDH staff is constantly fixing or cleaning up this area 
Will compare warren (today) to sixth which is more chaotic ",12:16:00 PM

Difficult to keep track of subjects while maintaining a lack of bias

Many take the food containers home if they do not entirely finish their portion

Not all of the indoor/outdoor here have proper signage posted (mostly only the compost one and even then, it's fairly minimal)

Lunch rush picked as predicted, at 12

People typically come here to study

Three out of the four eating places at OVT didn't open until 11am, that may have contributed to the lack of people coming here before noon

There were three places to dispose of food waste, two of them were more heavily utilized than the other one",12:20:00 AM

Either most students tend not to use them or they tend not to have them, but reusable dishes are few and far between

Some items are blocking the labels on the bins, making it more difficult to determine what should be sorted where

Pizza is a menu option, and there is a separate stack for the boxes on top of the bins where employees can move them manually

Diners tend to either take their food to go or take their time eating it

The majority of diners tend to be upperclassmen, grad/post-grad students, and researchers employed at the medical school

Regardless of contents, diners tend to throw away all paper trash in the ""landfill"" bin

The compost bin is next to and shorter than the recycling bin, making it more difficult to see

Club Med tends to be further out of the way than other eateries, meaning that the number of patrons tends to be fewer as a general rule ",1:55:00 PM
