# [It's Time to Meat Your Maker: Optimizing Food Waste Disposal](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF-kwS73YI/rQNrQnlbima1RnboS5vJ6Q/edit?utm_content=DAF-kwS73YI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

This data analysis was created as a part of a project Vanessa Elizalde, Christopher Chou, Aidan Thompson, and I (Artemis Lopez) worked on together while taking
the course **SYN 100: Synthesis 100**: the upper-division writing course for Seventh College at UCSD.

It reflects the knowledge gleaned from the data we gathered, all related to designing the optimal arrangement of food waste disposal containers
in the dining halls on campus. We conducted a naturalistic observational study, pinpointing the following metrics:

* Number of People Who Viewed the Waste Disposal Signs
* Number of People Who "Properly" Disposed of Waste
* Number of People Who "Improperly" Disposed of Waste

## Driving Question

How does communicating the importance of food waste reduction within Housing and Dining Services (HDH) dining halls translate into mindful student behaviors? 
How do current HDH policies and practices promote or detract from this message?

### Additional Materials

In addition to the data analysis, I worked in Figma to create the following files:
