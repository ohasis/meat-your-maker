# It's Time to Meat Your Maker: Optimizing Food Waste Disposal

This data analysis was created as a part of a project Vanessa Elizalde, Christopher Chou, Aidan Thompson, and I worked on together while taking
the course **SYN 100: Synthesis 100**: the upper-division writing course for Seventh College.

It reflects the knowledge gleaned from the data we gathered, all related to designing the optimal arrangement of food waste disposal containers
in the dining halls on campus. We conducted a naturalistic observational study, pinpointing the following metrics:

* Number of People Who Viewed the Waste Disposal Signs
* Number of People Who "Properly" Disposed of Waste
* Number of People Who "Improperly" Disposed of Waste

### Driving Question

How does communicating the importance of food waste reduction within Housing and Dining Services (HDH) dining halls translate into mindful student behaviors? 
How do current HDH policies and practices promote or detract from this message?
